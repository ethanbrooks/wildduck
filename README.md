# WildDuck Mail Server

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodemailer/wildduck/master/assets/duck.png)

WildDuck is a scalable no-SPOF IMAP/POP3 mail server. WildDuck uses a distributed database (sharded + replicated MongoDB) as a backend for storing all data,
including emails.

WildDuck tries to follow Gmail in product design. If there's a decision to be made then usually the answer is to do whatever Gmail has done.
